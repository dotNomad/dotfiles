# dotNomad's dotfiles

A simple group of dotfiles that I'm sure will expand as I hunt for new features,
functions, and improvements

## Install

Use symlinks for the wanted files

```
ln -s ~/development/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

### Git Config

The `.gitconfig.local` file is included by `.gitconfig`. Use it to store user
information.

```
[user]
    name = Jordan Jensen
    email = fake@invalid.com
```

- [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
    - [`fzf-tab`](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab)

If there is not a specific piece of software the commit targets then it can be
excluded
